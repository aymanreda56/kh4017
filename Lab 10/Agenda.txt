Assert
difference between assert and if else


Exceptions (what are their sources?)
Look at the different types of exceptions

Handling general exceptions (try except)

Handling specific types of exceptions

Handling multiple exceptions at once

Making a custom exception

Raising an exception (What if you are writing code that someone else will use, you have to prevent him from misusing your code)


Advantages
Below are some benefits of using exception handling:

Improved reliability: Programs don’t crash on unexpected input.
Separation of concerns: Error-handling code stays separate from business logic.
Cleaner code: Fewer conditional checks scattered in code.
Helpful debugging: Tracebacks show exactly where the problem occurred.
Disadvantages
Exception handling have some cons as well which are listed below:

Performance overhead: Handling exceptions is slower than simple condition checks.
Added complexity: Multiple exception types may complicate code.
Security risks: Poorly handled exceptions might leak sensitive details.
